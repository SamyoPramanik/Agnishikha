## Overview

**AstraFlame** is Team **Agnishikha**'s project for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2026** (Dhaka), challenge **"Flame in Freefall: AI-Powered Fire Safety Insights from Microgravity Combustion Data"**.

In microgravity, fire does not rise. It burns as a sphere, can survive at lower oxygen, and does not follow the rules we learn on Earth. NASA has run hundreds of fire experiments on the International Space Station and on unmanned Cygnus vehicles. That knowledge is spread across separate investigations, file formats and papers.

AstraFlame brings those experiments together. You give it a condition: oxygen level, pressure, airflow and material. It answers with:

- how fast a fire will spread,
- whether a flame will go out,
- how sooty or smoky it will be,
- how large the smoke particles will be.

Every answer comes with an error band, the NASA evidence behind it, and an honest warning when NASA never tested that condition.

## My Role

I'm the **Data Science Lead** on Team Agnishikha.

**Data.** I built the project's dataset from NASA's Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) repository.
- I found the files that hold the measured results, not just the test settings.
- I verified every extract byte-for-byte against NASA's copy.
- I cleaned and documented ten sources into one 850-row table.

**Models.** I trained and validated the five machine-learning models in `models/`.
- I chose each model from the project's objective (a fire-risk envelope with honest uncertainty), not by score alone.
- I designed the preprocessing for the chosen model: physics space, logged cleaning, test groups and measured noise.
- Every candidate was scored with **nested grouped cross-validation** on ISS tests it never saw.
- Each model is checked against a simple baseline and a replicate-based noise ceiling.

**Interface.** I wrote the single `predict()` interface, the model API in `api/` that serves it, and the dashboard's **NASA Models** tab that calls it.

The dashboard UI in `agnishikha-ui/` was built by our UI & Software Lead, **Tawhid Bin Omar**.

This repo is my copy of the project, kept here alongside my other work.

## NASA Data

All source data is public domain (**CC0-1.0**) from [NASA Physical Sciences Informatics](https://psi.nasa.gov).

| Investigation | PSI record | What was measured | Rows used |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FLEX** — Flame Extinguishment Experiment | [PSI-69](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-69) · DOI 10.60555/mbq8-0451 | Droplet flame extinction, burning rate | 274 |
| **SPICE** — Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment | [PSI-107](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-107) · DOI 10.60555/9kbh-e962 | Smoke point of gas-jet flames | 55 |
| **SAME / SAME-R** — Smoke Aerosol Measurement | [PSI-102](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-102), [PSI-101](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-101) | Smoke particle size and concentration | 154 |
| **BASS** — Burning and Suppression of Solids | [PSI-26](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-26) | Burn outcome and crew observations | 121 |
| **BASS-II** | [PSI-25](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-25) + Link et al. 2018, *Sci. Rep.* 8:120 | Flame spread over PMMA rods, gas response | 181 |
| **Saffire I–III** — Spacecraft Fire Experiment | [PSI-98](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-98), [PSI-99](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-99), [PSI-100](https://psi.nasa.gov/physci/repo/data/investigations/PSI-100) | Large-scale flame spread, with a 1g comparison | 13 |
| **WSTF 1g reference** | Hirsch et al. 2011, NTRS 20110008636 | Maximum oxygen concentration on Earth | 52 (comparison only) |

**A finding worth seeing:** in Saffire-II, silicone burned completely in 1g but **did not spread at all in microgravity**. Earth-based fire rules do not transfer directly to space.

Full documentation is in `data/README.md` (layout, lineage, data contract, changelog), `data/README_dataset_v1.0.md` and the workbook `data/processed/Ignis_mu_NASA_dataset_v1.0.xlsx`. Start with its *Data_Map* sheet.

## Habitat fire map (novelty thread)

NASA has run **no microgravity fire test at or below 70 kPa**; the proposed habitat is 56.5 kPa (8.2 psia, 34% O2).
`models/habitat_map.py` builds one map: FLEX extinction model, every NASA microgravity test, the 22 WSTF material
limits (20 of 22 burn at 34% O2 in 1g), the ISS and habitat points, and the next tests to run. API: `GET /habitat`,
`POST /habitat/locate` (a live chamber reading placed on the map). Dashboard: **Habitat Map** tab.
Layers differ (microgravity droplets vs 1g solids) and are labelled as such. Decision support, not certification.

## Use of AI

AI assistants (Claude) were used to help write code, tests and documentation. All data is NASA public-domain data;
results were checked by the team against the NASA sources.

## Models

The models were chosen from the objective. The fire-risk envelope asks three things: will a flame survive, how fast does it spread or burn, and how sure is the answer. For the three outputs that feed the safe-cabin map, I use a **physics-informed Gaussian process (PI-GP)**. The two smoke outputs keep the most accurate v2 ensemble. All scores come from nested grouped cross-validation on identical held-out ISS tests. Full method: [models/MODEL_SELECTION_v3.md](models/MODEL_SELECTION_v3.md).

| # | Model | Question | Final model | Score | Physics violations | v2 on same tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bass2_flame_spread` | How fast does flame spread over a PMMA rod? | PI-GP | R² 0.57, 90 % coverage 86.5 % | 0 % | R² 0.62 |
| 2 | `flex_extinction` | Will a fuel-droplet flame go out? | PI-GP classifier | ROC-AUC **0.87**, Brier **0.082**, balanced accuracy **0.78**, macro F1 0.70 | 2.4 % | AUC 0.83, Brier 0.090, 22 % violations |
| 3 | `flex_burning_rate` | How fast does the droplet burn? | PI-GP | R² **0.71** (ceiling ≈ 0.72), coverage 89.7 % | 0 % | R² 0.71 |
| 4 | `spice_smoke_point` | How sooty is a gas flame? | v2 ensemble | R² **0.89**, MAE 4.4 mm | 0 % | — |
| 5 | `same_particle_size` | How large are smoke particles? | v2 ensemble | R² 0.43 | 43 % | — |

How I chose the models:

- **Objective first.** Map outputs must be accurate, follow physics and give uncertainty that grows outside NASA's data. Smoke outputs are read inside the tested range, so accuracy decides there. This rule was set before the comparison.
- **PI-GP = physics law + GP correction + ISS-test offset.**
  - The correction is kept only when grouped inner CV shows it beats the physics law alone. For flame spread it was dropped.
  - Far from data the model returns to physics by itself.
  - Its uncertainty points to the next most useful ISS experiment.
- **Preprocessing designed for the model.**
  - Physics space: log transforms, O₂ partial pressure, 1/diameter.
  - Unclear outcomes removed, with every reason logged.
  - ISS-test groups kept.
  - Replicate-measured noise used as the prior.
- **Physics stays in.** SPICE recovers the published scaling of Dotson et al. (2011): smoke-point length ∝ burner diameter^−0.76 × coflow velocity^0.41.
- **Decision threshold for extinction.** 87 % of the ISS droplet tests ended in extinction, so accuracy alone is misleading (always answering "goes out" scores 0.87). The yes/no threshold is chosen by balanced accuracy on grouped out-of-fold predictions (0.67 in production). Scored with the threshold chosen inside each training set, 72 % of the rare "burns to completion" tests are caught (35 % at a 0.5 threshold).
- **Honest limits.** v2 is slightly more accurate on flame spread (0.62 vs 0.57, overlapping CIs). Flame spread and burning rate sit near their replicate noise ceilings (≈ 0.68 and 0.72), so new experiments, not new models, would improve them.

</p>

**Where NASA should test next.** The models know where they are unsure. Combining that uncertainty with the distance from every existing test, they recommend the next ISS experiments: a 3 mm methanol droplet at **32 % O₂, 144 kPa** (the outcome there is a coin toss) and flame spread over a 6.4 mm rod at **21 % O₂, 7.5 cm/s** airflow (the largest uncertainty). This is a simple rule, not a full Bayesian experimental design.

**The problem in numbers.** Of the 22 materials whose oxygen limits NASA measured (Hirsch et al. 2011), **20 would keep burning in the 34 % oxygen proposed for Moon habitats** (12 already do in Earth air). These limits come from Earth-gravity tests at 70–101 kPa, so this is a first estimate for 8.2 psia.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prachyabiswas/NASA-Space-Apps-2026.git
cd NASA-Space-Apps-2026
```

### 2. Run the data-science pipeline

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt          # pinned versions; scikit-learn 1.9.1 is required by the model files
python run_pipeline.py                   # about 10 min: reproducible ETL -> data contract -> training -> evaluation -> tests
python run_pipeline.py --full            # everything from scratch, about 50 min
python tests/run_tests.py                # test suite only (or: pytest tests)
```

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "models")
from ignis_models import predict
predict("flex_extinction", fuel="Methanol", pressure_kpa=101.3, o2_pct=18, co2_pct=0, he_pct=0, d0_mm=3.0)
predict("spice_smoke_point", fuel="Propylene", burner_diameter_mm=1.6, coflow_air_velocity_cm_s=30)
```

### Full results notebook

[`notebooks/AstraFlame_Full_ML_Pipeline.ipynb`](notebooks/AstraFlame_Full_ML_Pipeline.ipynb) runs the whole data-science part in one place (about 15 minutes on a laptop): data checks, preprocessing, the grouped train/validation/test design, noise ceilings, every model on identical held-out ISS tests (R², MAE, coverage, ROC-AUC, Brier, accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1, confusion matrix), the improvements tried, the physics check and the final results. It is saved with its outputs, so the results can be read on GitHub without running it.

### Or run everything in Google Colab

Open [`notebooks/Ignis_mu_Model_Selection_v2.ipynb`](notebooks/Ignis_mu_Model_Selection_v2.ipynb) in Colab ([open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/prachyabiswas/NASA-Space-Apps-2026/blob/main/notebooks/Ignis_mu_Model_Selection_v2.ipynb)) and choose `Runtime → Run all`. The notebook then:
- rebuilds all five models from the NASA data, including the objective-driven v3 (PI-GP) models
- shows the leakage demo, the noise ceilings and the nested selection
- runs the physics checks

It needs no login and takes about 30 minutes.

### 3. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

Start both the Model API backend and the Next.js frontend in one command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- **Dashboard UI**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (open the **NASA Models** or **Habitat Map** tab)
- **Model API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (`GET /health`, `GET /models`)

For live-reloading during development:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

To run test suites inside the API container:
```bash
docker compose run --rm api python tests/run_tests.py
```

### 4. Run manually (Model API and dashboard)

```bash
python api/server.py                     # http://127.0.0.1:8000  (GET /models, POST /predict/{model})
curl -X POST localhost:8000/predict/flex_extinction -d '{"fuel": "Heptane", "co2_pct": 20}'

cd agnishikha-ui
npm install
npm run dev                              # http://localhost:3000, open the "NASA Models" tab
```

The tab calls the API at `NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNIS_API_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Without the API, for example on a static deploy, it uses `public/ignis/*.json`: answers precomputed by `api/export_static.py` from the same trained models, one input at a time around NASA reference conditions, and labelled as precomputed.

### 5. Rebuild and check the dataset from NASA's files

```bash
python data/scripts/build_all.py --check      # rebuild every processed file and prove it is byte-for-byte identical
python data/scripts/validate_processed.py     # strict data contract: schema, physics bounds, consistency, lineage
```

## Status and Limits

- **Dashboard:** the NASA Models tab shows the trained models. The Simulation, Risk Matrix, Explainability and Protocols tabs still use a client-side surrogate for the live scenario and say so in the footer.
- **Hosting the API:** it must run on a Python host for free input combinations; a static deploy gets the precomputed answers only.
- **Data size:** 52–256 rows per model. The scores are honest held-out numbers, but the error bands are wide (95 % CIs are in `models/reports/model_summary.json`). For flame spread and burning rate the remaining error is mostly run-to-run noise, so more ISS experiments, not more modelling, would improve them.
- **High oxygen:** extinction errors rise above 21 % O₂, the conditions closest to the habitat air, because NASA ran few tests there (see the notebook's error analysis).
- **1g data:** the WSTF ground reference is a comparison layer and is never used to train microgravity models.
- **Missing outcomes:** the FLEX-2 and Cool Flames Investigation tables list test conditions only, so they are not modelled.
